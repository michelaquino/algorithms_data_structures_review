# Algorithms and Data Structures Review

## CLRS
From the esteemed "Introduction to Algorithms (3rd Edition)" (ISBN-13: 978-0262033848) book by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein:

Chapters missing implementation:
- Chapter 1: This is introducing the concept of algorihtms and does not include any codeable text.
- Chapter 3: Nothing to implement.
- Chapter 17: This chapter talks about a particular type of algorithm analysis (amortized analysis), rather than introducing algorithms or data structures.
- Chapter 30: The only problem introduced and covered in this chapter is the Fourier transform. I did not get to implementing it.
- Chapter 31: This chapter mostly talks about the arithmatic framework used for data encryption and the RSA.
- Chapter 33: This chapter includes abstractions for working with geometric concepts and a number of algorithms for doing routine operations on geometric shapes. I never got down to implementing them, though they are among the most straightforward in this book.
- Chapter 34: This chapter talks about the concept of NP-Completeness, and while does include many problem definitions, the problems are only solvable by brute-force and very inefficient algorithms. I didn't need the practice, so I didn't include them.
- Chapter 35: The algorithms outlined in this chapter are approximation algorithms. I didn't get down to implementing them.
