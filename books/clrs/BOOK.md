## Implementations
- [x] Chapter 1 - This is introducing the concept of algorihtms and does not include any codeable text.
- [ ] Chapter 2
- [x] Chapter 3 -  Nothing to implement.
- [ ] Chapter 4
- [ ] Chapter 5
- [ ] Chapter 6
- [ ] Chapter 7
- [ ] Chapter 8
- [ ] Chapter 9
- [ ] Chapter 10
- [ ] Chapter 11
- [ ] Chapter 12
- [ ] Chapter 13
- [ ] Chapter 14
- [ ] Chapter 15
- [ ] Chapter 16
- [x] Chapter 17 - This chapter talks about a particular type of algorithm analysis (amortized analysis), rather than introducing algorithms or data structures.
- [ ] Chapter 18
- [ ] Chapter 19
- [ ] Chapter 20
- [ ] Chapter 21
- [ ] Chapter 22
- [ ] Chapter 23
- [ ] Chapter 24
- [ ] Chapter 25
- [ ] Chapter 26
- [ ] Chapter 27
- [ ] Chapter 28
- [ ] Chapter 29
- [x] Chapter 30 - The only problem introduced and covered in this chapter is the Fourier transform. I did not get to implementing it.
- [x] Chapter 31 - This chapter mostly talks about the arithmatic framework used for data encryption and the RSA.
- [ ] Chapter 32
- [x] Chapter 33 - This chapter includes abstractions for working with geometric concepts and a number of algorithms for doing routine operations on geometric shapes. I never got down to implementing them, though they are among the most straightforward in this book.
- [x] Chapter 34 - This chapter talks about the concept of NP-Completeness, and while does include many problem definitions, the problems are only solvable by brute-force and very inefficient algorithms. I didn't need the practice, so I didn't include them.
- [x] Chapter 35 - The algorithms outlined in this chapter are approximation algorithms. I didn't get down to implementing them.
